        <p><b>Our Mission:</b> Empower schools to become more eco-friendly through smart, trackable recycling systems
            that inspire environmental responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Smart Trash Bin project is designed to promote sustainability and encourage eco-friendly practices on
            campus.
            By monitoring the amount of recycling collected in real time, our system helps track participation and
            motivates students and staff to recycle more.
            Each bin is equipped with a module that includes a microcomputer, weight detector, and rechargeable battery.
            The collected data is sent to a secure network for analysis, allowing the Eco Warriors team and school
            administrators to evaluate recycling trends and improve strategies.
        </p>
        <br>
