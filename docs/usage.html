        <h2>How to Use the Smart Recycling Bins</h2>
        <p>
            Using the smart bins is simple. Students and staff should dispose of recyclable items like paper, plastic
            bottles, and cans into the designated recycling bins.
            The sensors inside the bins automatically track the weight and usage of the bin without requiring any
            additional input from the user.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happens Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>
            As users recycle, the internal module records the weight of the contents in real time.
            This information is sent wirelessly to a secure network where it is stored and analyzed by the Eco Warriors
            team.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing the Data</h2>
        <p>
            Authorized users such as student leaders or school administrators can access the data through a secure
            dashboard or app interface.
            The data is used to track trends, compare recycling levels by location, and develop targeted campaigns to
            encourage more participation.
        </p>

        <h2>Hopes for the Future</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Recycling bins and other bins are distinctively seperated </li>
            <li>Encourage others to participate and keep bins clear of non-recyclables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits for Users</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time feedback on recycling performance can be shared during school announcements or events.</li>
            <li>Top-performing classrooms or buildings can be rewarded as part of an incentive program.</li>
            <li>Students gain awareness of sustainability through active participation.</li>
        </ul>
